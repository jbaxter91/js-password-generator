# Js-password-generator
## This project was designed to be a drop in javascript password generator with multiple options for generating the password.  This project will generate passwords between 8 - 126 characters long, with options to include uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.  This program is great for anyone who wants a fast secure random password now!

## How to use
Go to my live website or load this project on your own system.  

Open index.html and you will be faced with a Generate password button.  

After you click the button you will be prompted to set a password length. Enter in a number between 8 and 128

Now you will recieve prompts asking what types of characters you want to use in your password.  You must select at least one option.
### Availible options
* Lowercase A-Z characters
* Uppercase A-Z characters
* Special Characters (!@#$%^&*)
* Numbers (0-9)

After you are done selecting options your new password will be output into the readonly text field.  And thats it!

## The future?
I think going forward i would like to add check boxes for these options to make password generation faster, hopefully just one click at some point.  Another useful feature might be to have the text automaticlly copy to your clipboard... again to save the user on clicks.
